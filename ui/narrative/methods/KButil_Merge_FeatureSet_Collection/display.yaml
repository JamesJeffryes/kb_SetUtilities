    <h3>Description</h3>
    <b>Merge Feature Sets</b> allows a user to collapse multiple Feature Set objects into a single Feature Set object.  This may be useful in scenarios where features are identified as being of interest from multiple approaches, and the user wishes to follow up investigation of those features together.
