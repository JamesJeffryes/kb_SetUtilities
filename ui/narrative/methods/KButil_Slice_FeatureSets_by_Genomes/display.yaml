    <h3>Description</h3>
    <b>Slice Feature Sets by Genomes</b> allows a user to subset Feature Set objects to only include features from user-defined genomes.  A feature set is output for each input feature set.  The configuration of the genomes is done using Genome objects that are present in the active Narrative, so those must be imported and used to create the Feature Sets subject to slicing.  A null result will not create an empty Feature Set.
